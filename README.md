## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this challlenge I've learned how to stretch or flatten elements vertically or horizontally with the property ``` transform: scale(x, y)```, where x is the vertical axis and y is the horizontal axis.

```css
.element {
  transform: scale(1, 0.9);
}
```

At first I could not find a way to make the ```box-shadow``` on the button overlap the cancel order element. Then I made ```background-color``` of the cancel order element transparent and the issue was solved.

### Useful resources

- [TopTal Utilities](https://www.toptal.com/developers/css3maker) - The CSS Transform tool available on this site helped me to flatten the price text.
